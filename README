        my $content = qURL( http://transfixedbutnotdead.com );   # does HTTP request

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a Quote-like operator which returns a HTTP request
    using the LWP::Simple module.

    Please see PerlX::QuoteOperator for more detail on Quote-like
    operators.

    For now here is another example:

        use PerlX::QuoteOperator::URL 'qh';
        use JSON qw(decode_json);
    
        say decode_json( qh{ http://twitter.com/statuses/show/6592721580.json } )->{text};
    
        # => "He nose the truth."
        

EXPORT
