DESCRIPTION

    For more info see PerlX::QuoteOperator::URL.

    For now here is another example:

        use PerlX::QuoteOperator::URL 'qh';
        use JSON qw(decode_json);
    
        say decode_json( qh{ http://twitter.com/statuses/show/6592721580.json } )->{text};
    
        # => "He nose the truth."
        

EXPORT

    This can be changed by providing a name of your own choice:
